    <description>Never wonder what Lemegeton wisps you have again.

[h1][b]Features[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] Displays all your Lemegeton item wisps when holding tab
[*] Works with wisps gained from any source, including modded items
[*] Matches your HUD offset
[*] Vertical offset can be changed by pressing + or -
[/list]

[h1][b]Important info that you should READ[/b][/h1]
It's currently impossible in the API to get the offset of the map when holding tab. The best solution I came up with, as mentioned above, is that you can manually adjust the vertical offset of the list with the + and - keys on your keyboard. If you comment about the map covering the list, you will be permanently banned from this plane of existence :)
